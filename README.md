# Data Engineering Project
## By Owen Rose

#### Iteration 1
Due on 2/6/2020
for this Iteration, I wrote the a Maven Project that 
would open a CSV file using OpenCSV which is a program 
used for reading said file. After it reads the file it
then prints out the contents of the file into the console
or output.
